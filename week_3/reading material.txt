McCabe module by Ned's script.
This module provides a plugin for flake8, the Python code checker.
You can install, upgrade, uninstall mccabe with these commands:
$ pip install mccabe
$ pip install --upgrade mccabe
$ pip uninstall mccabe

By default the plugin is disabled. Use the --max-complexity switch to enable it. It will emit a warning if the McCabe complexity of a function is higher than the provided value:
$ flake8 --max-complexity 10 coolproject
...
coolproject/mod.py:1204:1: C901 'CoolFactory.prepare' is too complex (14)

This feature is quite useful for detecting over-complex code. According to McCabe, anything that goes beyond 10 is too complex.



API

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.
